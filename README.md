## 🚖 Uber Rides Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Uber rides dataset to uncover key insights about **travel patterns, payment methods (UPI, Cash, Credit Card, Google Pay), and popular routes**. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to identify trends that can enhance ride efficiency and user experience.

### 📊 **Key Features & Analysis**  
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.  
✔ **Payment Analysis:** Identifying the most used payment methods (UPI, Cash, Credit Card, Google Pay) and city-wise trends.  
✔ **Popular Routes Analysis:** Discovering the most frequently traveled routes based on origin and destination.  
✔ **City-Wise Insights:** Determining which cities have the most Uber ride requests.  
✔ **Data Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps.
